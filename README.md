# AI Product Launch Decision System 🚀
### Multi-Brain AI Decision Intelligence Platform

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **AI Product Launch Decision System** is a decision-support platform that helps teams determine **whether and when a product should be launched**.  
Instead of relying on intuition or a single AI model, the system simulates a **real product launch committee** using **multiple AI brains** and a **consensus engine**.

This project is built using **Python, Flask, JWT authentication, MongoDB**, and **AI models (OpenAI / CrewAI-ready)**.

---

## ❓ Why This Project Is Needed

Many products fail because of:
- ❌ Wrong launch timing  
- ❌ Market misunderstanding  
- ❌ Ignoring risk and business readiness  

Traditional tools provide analytics but **do not make explainable decisions**.

👉 This system uses **multiple AI models** to simulate how a real launch committee evaluates a product.

## 🧠 Core Concept

> **Complex launch decisions should not be made by a single AI.  
They require collaborative intelligence.**

Each AI brain analyzes the product from a different angle, and a moderator combines their insights.

---

## 🔐 Authentication (JWT)

- User login & registration implemented using **JWT**
- Secure access to dashboard and decision pages
- Tokens protect all critical routes

---

## 🖥️ Application Flow

### 1️⃣ Login / Home
- Product managers or team members log in securely
- JWT token issued on successful login

---

### 2️⃣ Dashboard
- Start new product analysis
- View previous launch decisions
- Track status: Launch / Delay / Cancel

---

### 3️⃣ Product Input
User provides:
- Product name
- Product type (Mobile / Web / Medical)
- Feature completion percentage
- Target users
- Planned release date
- Marketing readiness

👉 This input triggers AI analysis.

---

### 4️⃣ Multi-AI Brain Analysis (Core Feature)

Independent AI brains analyze the product:

- **Market Brain** – demand & competition  
- **Product Brain** – feature readiness & stability  
- **Timing Brain** – best release window  
- **Risk Brain** – technical, ethical, legal risk  
- **Business Brain** – ROI & long-term impact  

Each brain produces:
- Score (0–100)
- Reasoning

---

### 5️⃣ Consensus Engine (AI Moderator)

- Collects all AI brain outputs
- Resolves conflicts
- Applies domain-specific safety rules (especially for medical apps)
- Produces final decision

---

### 6️⃣ Final Decision

Output includes:
- Recommendation: Launch / Delay / Conditional Launch
- Confidence score
- Best release window
- Explainable reasoning

---

### 7️⃣ Visualization & Reports
- Score comparison across AI brains
- Downloadable decision report
- Stored decision history

---

### 8️⃣ History
- View past decisions
- Learn from previous outcomes
- Supports iterative improvement
