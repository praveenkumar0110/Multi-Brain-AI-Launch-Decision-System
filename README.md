# AI Product Launch Decision System 🚀  
### Multi-Brain AI Decision Intelligence Platform 🧠

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **AI Product Launch Decision System** is a decision-support platform that helps teams decide **whether and when a product should be launched**.  
Instead of relying on intuition or a single AI model, the system simulates a **real product launch committee** using **multiple AI brains** and a **consensus engine**.

This project is built using **Python, Flask, JWT authentication, MongoDB**, and **AI models (OpenAI / CrewAI-ready)**.

---

## ❓ Why This Project Is Needed

Many products fail due to:
- ❌ Wrong launch timing  
- ❌ Market misunderstanding  
- ❌ Ignoring risk and business readiness  

Traditional tools focus on analytics but **do not provide explainable launch decisions**.

👉 This system uses **multiple AI models** to simulate how a real launch committee evaluates a product.

## 🧠 Key Innovation

| Feature | Market Tools | This System |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| Single AI decision | ✅ | ❌ |
| Multi-AI brains | ❌ | ✅ |
| Independent AI analysis | ❌ | ✅ |
| Consensus engine | ❌ | ✅ |
| Explainable decisions | ⚠️ Partial | ✅ |
| Academic novelty | ❌ | ✅ |

## 🧩 Core Concept

> **Complex launch decisions should not be made by a single AI.  
They require collaborative intelligence.**

Each AI brain analyzes the product from a different perspective, and a moderator combines their insights to reach a final decision.

---

## 🔐 Authentication

- Secure user login and registration using **JWT**
- Token-protected access to all dashboards and decision routes

---

## 🖥️ Application Flow

### 1️⃣ Login  
Users authenticate securely using JWT.

### 2️⃣ Dashboard  
Users can start a new product analysis and view previous decisions.

### 3️⃣ Product Input  
Basic product details such as type, readiness level, target users, and release date are provided.

### 4️⃣ Multi-AI Analysis 🤖  
Multiple AI brains independently analyze the product from market, product, timing, risk, and business perspectives.

### 5️⃣ Consensus Engine 🧠  
An AI moderator combines all AI outputs and resolves conflicts.

### 6️⃣ Final Decision ✅  
The system produces a clear recommendation with confidence and reasoning.

### 7️⃣ Reports and History 📊  
All decisions are stored and can be reviewed for learning and documentation.
